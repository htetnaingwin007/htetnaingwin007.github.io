                <h2>Early life and education</h2>

                <p>
                    Lee was born on 16 September 1923, the first child of Lee Chin Koon, a Semarang-born Singaporean, and Chua Jim Neo, at 92 Kampong Java Road in Singapore, then part of the British Empire. He sailed from Singapore on his 23rd birthday on the MV Britannic, arriving in the UK on 3 October. He initially enrolled at the London School of Economics, but found himself disliking life in the British capital.He visited Cambridge in November and was introduced to W. S. Thatcher, Censor of Fitzwilliam House. He was admitted into the following year's Lent term and matriculated in January 1947, reading law at Fitzwilliam College.

                <h2>Carrer</h2>

                <p>Lee and his wife returned to Singapore in August 1950 on board the MS Willem Ruys. He joined the Laycock and Ong law firm founded by British lawyer John Laycock.Laycock was a co-founder of the pro-British Progressive Party and Lee represented the party during the 1951 legislative council election as an election agent.Lee was called to the Singapore bar on 7 August 1951.Early in 1959, Communications and Works Minister Francis Thomas received evidence of corruption on Education Minister Chew Swee Kee. Thomas brought the evidence to Lee after the chief minister dismissed the matter.[127] Lee tabled a motion in the assembly on 17 February, which forced Chew's resignation.[127] As the expiry of the assembly's term approached, the PAP was initially split on whether to capture power but Lee chose to proceed.[128] While picking the candidates, Lee deliberately chose people from different racial and education backgrounds to repair the party's image of being run by intellectuals.[129] In the 1959 general election held on 30 May 1959, the PAP won a landslide victory with 43 of the 51 seats, though with only 53.4% of the popular vote which Lee noted.[129][130]The PAP's victory reportedly created a dilemma within the 12-member CEC as there was no formal process in place to choose a prime minister-elect.[131] A vote was purportedly held between Lee and Ong Eng Guan and after both men received six votes, party chairman Toh Chin Chye cast the tie-breaking vote for Lee.[132] When interviewed nearly five decades later, Toh and one other party member recalled the vote, but Lee and several others denied the account.[132] Lee was summoned by Governor William Goode to form a new government on 1 June, to which he requested the release of arrested PAP members.[133] On 3 June, Singapore became a self-governing state, ending 140 years of direct British rule.[133] Lee was sworn in as Prime Minister of Singapore on 5 June at City Hall, along with the rest of his Cabinet.[133]</p>
